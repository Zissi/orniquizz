A quiz for bird images and sounds, written in PyQt.

# Install

Depends on pyqt and phonon.

Images, Sounds and Meta-Information can be downloaded from https://github.com/giletvin/ornidroid, a very nice ornithology app.
Put the images found at https://github.com/giletvin/ornidroid/tree/master/ornidroid_images/src_images into a folder called 'images' in the top directory of this code. Repeat the same for the sounds found at https://github.com/giletvin/ornidroid/tree/master/ornidroid_audio/src_audio, the target folder should be called 'audio'.
For the meta-information download 'ornidroid.jpg' from https://github.com/giletvin/ornidroid/tree/master/ornidroid/assets and rename it 'ornidroid.sqlite' (it is in fact a sqlite file).
